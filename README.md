#ImageColorSorting

Find out which colours make up a bunch of images, try to filter the images by their colour content and then look at them. Nice, eh?

I have tried to keep this simple, as it is a quick hack, or an experiment, to show the image handling capabilities of javascript and modern browsers.

Making good use of other people's hard work, such as [imagesLoaded](https://github.com/desandro/imagesloaded "imagesLoaded"), [EventEmitter](https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter/ "EventEmitter") and [Color Thief](https://github.com/lokesh/color-thief/ "Color Thief").
