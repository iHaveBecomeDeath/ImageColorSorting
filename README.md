ImageColorSorting
=================

Find out what colours make up a bunch of images, try to filter them by their colour content and then look at them. Long and hard.

I have tried to keep this simple, as it is just a quick hack, or an experiment, to show the image handling capabilities of javascript and modern browsers.

Making good use of other people's hard work, such as imagesLoaded, EventEmitter and Color Thief.

Serve this locally.
